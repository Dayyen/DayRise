            <h1>Communication</h1>
            <p>A majority of mental health related issues could be reduced in magnitude or removed alltogether by clear and correct communication. Developing a clear line of communication with your loved ones who may be feeling depressed or overly frustrated is crucial as it provides you an insight of what they're going through. It helps in understanding the situation in the first place.<br> <br> You have to also make sure they don't feel judged or criticised in a conversation or when they're trying to explain something. Listening is the first step. Grasp the situation and their condition before going ahead to say something that may end up worsening them or making them more anxious. Don't say what you think is right, say what you think is the best option for them, or the most healthiest option for them. <br> <br> It may sound like a small simple thing but it usually ends up being neglected.
