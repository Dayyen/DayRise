            <h1>Socialising</h1>
            <p>Time and time it has been proven that maintaining social relationships with your loved ones or people you feel comfortable with is the best way to move forward curing depression. With the Covid-19 Pandemic, our ability to socialise has been crippled extensively. Even so there still exist many ways you can maintain social relationships to not feel dejected from society. As with classes occuring online, you can contact your friends and family online, on video calls etc. The hard part is maintaining a routine with it. <br> <br> Every day or every week and regular intervals put aside some time to go out and meet some people or to just remember to call your friends or text them. Any form of communication to connect you to your loved ones brings you back to society and helps you remember that there are people delighted to be around you and talk to you.
